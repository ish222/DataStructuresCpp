# Data Structures in C++

The repo contains a *header-only library* with the following **custom templated data structures**:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph
- Map

These are classes with methods including adding, changeing, modifying, inserting, removing objects and more. There is also suppport for const types.

Things to add:

- Exhaustive testing of all data structures.
- Automate testing with GitHub actions.
- Supporting algorithms (maybe seperate repo).
- Documentation using doxygen.
